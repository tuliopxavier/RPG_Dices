<h1> RPG_Dices </h1>
A simple RPG dice simulator with one or two D4, D6, D10 and D20, just to practice DOM manipulation and math() methods with plain javascript. Enjoy! =)


## Next steps

- The logic is working well, 
- next I think to add some gifs to simulate the movement, 
- replace the buttons by dices images 
- or select the dice type in a <Select> form tag.
